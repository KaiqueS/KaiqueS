Howdy! I'm KaÃ­que Santos. I have a MSc in Political Science, and I am currently enrolled in an undergraduation in Mathematics.

I first started learning programming languages in 2014, when I found out that some researchers in Political Science used Agent-Based Models. Because of that,
I started studying C++, which is my current main programming language.

## Programming Languages

* C++: My main programming language. This is the one I use and know the most. I "like" it, i.e., I'm it's hostage.
* Python: I can "use" it more than I "know" it.
* R: the same as Python.
* Rust: Currently learning it. I really like it, no quotes here. As fast as C++, with a better language design and syntax.

## Other programming-related skills

Parallelism:

  * OpenMPI
  * CUDA
